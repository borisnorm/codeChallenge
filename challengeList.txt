* Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int
* Implement parseInt
* Implement squareroot function
* Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)
* Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *
* HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()

HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)
* Determine if a String is an int or a double
* HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String - think they mean longest?
! HARD: Print all permutations of a String

#pure coding questions
! HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right
* Print A string Zig Zag, based on the column space params
* Spiral Matrix, might be able to do this recursively ->

#Tree Questions
*Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree
*Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0
*Print a tree by levels
*Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
*Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.
*HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.
! HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings
