	a. Indentation is off
	b. i used num1 instead of nums1
	c. int object is not iterable heappush(h, (sum(val1, val2), (val1, val2)))
		#ERROR is i cannot do sum on a tuple, becaues its NOT iterable 
	d. parenthesis errors 
	e. Input was wrong returned the value, not just the array, not just [1]
		@I need to get these helper functions correct

	f. I need to handle the edge cases of null arrays
		It is popping nothing in the heap

	g. watch out for overpulling the heap
		if len(heap) == 0:
			return solution

	h. Memory limited exceded
		*if this is sorted, i need to use this some how and not sure how

292.
	a. indentation
	b. canWinNUm is not defined - do i do soluiton.method?
		b. this a class method so use self.
		c. helper function can be defined externally
		d. max recursion depth exceeded

226 - Invert need a helper function to return the original root of the tree
	#being that specific is necessary
	#This is the helper function to return the root
	*Check to make sure it is returning what you want
	
283 - Check edge cases where there is nothng you are looking for
	#In the while loop i need to check if it has gone out of bounds
	#that is the cleanest way probs
		#dont return anything? not even nums
	
	#I was actually WRONG about the logic, how to defeat the sanwhich
	#have 2 pointers that always advance?
	#ALSO HAVE RIGHT SEARCH FOR NON zero one and swap
		#the RIGHt looks for a nonzero number
			#Return statement is out of place here
			i returns immedaitely

	#I messed this up - maintaining the Relative order is key, no swapping
		#implement a shifter function to execute

100 - same tree need to add a check case
	#Missed the edge case of if node exists and other is None, then value cast eror
	#method sig, pay attention to non versus not none
