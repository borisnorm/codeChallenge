Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. Now do this in linear time without using division.

2. Groupon (medium)
Printers printing string messages for fortune cookies call an API and try to print a string message randomly. How would you implement this API and keep the responses random? Now what if you wanted a weighted response? (Eg. Given 3 string messages, you want the API to return messages 1, 2 and 3 in the ratio 1:2:5). How would you optimize if the API is being invoked repeatedly?

3. LinkedIn (easy)
Given two nodes of a tree, write a method to return the deepest (ie lowest) common ancestor of those nodes. Nodes contain parent-pointers.

(I have n^2 soltuion, should be a lin time one
4. Tripadvisor (easy)

A Binary tree is balanced if for every node, heights of left and right subtrees differ by no more than 1. An empty tree is balanced. How would you write a program to check if a tree is balanced?

5. Zillow (easy)

Find the first non-duplicate item in an array of strings (in linear time).

(There is probably a cleaner way to do this)
6. Qualtrics (medium)

Given a 2D array as input and a start point as well as an end point, output ‘True’ if there exists a path from the start point to end point that is decreasing along the way, otherwise print ‘False’:

| 100 | 40 | 20 |

| 80 | 30 | 10 |

| 100 | 101| 0 |

So in this case start (0,0) and end (2,2) would return true since this path exists: 100 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 0

You can move in any of four directions (left/right/up/down).

(I dont know how to DP this)
7. Snapchat (difficult)

Consider a scenario where a frog wants cross a river. The river is represented by a 1D array of 0s and 1s where a 0 represents water and a 1 represents a rock. This frog cannot swim but it can jump from stone to stone. In addition there are other constraints on how the frog moves:

Frog can jump the same distance as his previous jump
Frog can jump one more than his previous jump
Frog can jump one less than his previous jump
Now, given a river (1d array), can a frog cross the river without drowning? The frog cannot move a negative distance (ie it cannot go from right to left).

(This is lang specifc question)
8. Zenefits (easy/medium)

a. Given a list of numbers represented as a1/b1, a2/b2 return sum in the reduced form a/b.

b. Find the maximum difference between two elements of an array such that larger element appears after the smaller number.

(This is hard and needs more work from me)
9. Uber (difficult)

Implement a function that makes 10 http requests in parallel, returning the responses in the order in which the urls are defined

f([url1, url2, url3]) should return [body1, body2, body3]

10. Google (diffucult)

a. Find three numbers than sum to a target ‘t’.

b. Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly Lcharacters and is fully (left and right) justified.

For example,

words: [“This”, “is”, “an”, “example”, “of”, “text”, “justification.”]

L: 16.

Return the formatted lines as:

[

“This is an”,

“example of text”,

“justification. ”

]
